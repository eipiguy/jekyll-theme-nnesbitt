## How many times have I done this?

I'd say that third time is the charm, but I think we're past 3 by now. I want a website so bad. A clean one that's easy to make, and I think the time has finally come! =D

1. I tried hardcoding, and it's a steep learning curve, though it's the cleanest I've ever kept things. I want to aim at that again, but I need something up that I can maintain and add to easily.

2. I tried WordPress because I likes how sleek it looks, and how ubiquitous it is. But it also has a steep learning curve, and I can't do all the coding things that I want to do with it.

3. This site is made with Jekyll, which turns markdown documents into HTML (which was kind of the point of markdown in the first place). It works quite well. You find a theme, and then tweak it to your needs, and it often has all the bells and whistles you want out of a modern website by default.

## Can I just plug markdown again?

Nadia has a mantra she shared with me at one point I've really enjoyed. It was meant in terms of organizing systems, but like all things, I stretch it's intent as much as I can:

>Make it easy to put away.

This is such a big deal because it stops you from accumulating. If it's hard to find things, that can be dealt with, but if it's hard to put them away, you'll never enter anything into the system in the first place.

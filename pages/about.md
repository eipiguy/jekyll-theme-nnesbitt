Welcome! My name is **Neal**, but you'll see my handle `eipiguy` everywhere. That's pronounced "*ee-eye-pie-guy*", as in $$e^{i\pi}$$guy. Take the implications of that how you will. ;)

I'm currently planing on using this new website as a place to record and organize my project progress. I'm working on various things, and it will serve as somewhere between a development blog, portfolio, and just general play space.

This site is mostly for myself, but feel free to reach out at any of the linked social media sites. I don't check social media often, but I will *try* to get back to you. No promises! =P
